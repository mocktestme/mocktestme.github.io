            <div class="description-content">
                <p>The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is a standardized test that measures the English language ability of non-native speakers. It is widely accepted by universities, colleges, and organizations worldwide, particularly in the United States and Canada.</p>
                <h3>TOEFL iBT Format</h3>
                <p>The TOEFL iBT (Internet-Based Test) is the current standard format. It assesses reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills through integrated and independent tasks that simulate academic English usage.</p>
                <h3>Score Interpretation</h3>
                <p>TOEFL iBT scores range from 0-120, with each section (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking) scored from 0-30. Most universities require a minimum score of 80-100 for undergraduate admission.</p>
