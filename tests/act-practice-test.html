                    <li><strong>English (45 min, 75 questions):</strong> Grammar, punctuation, rhetoric</li>
                    <li><strong>Math (60 min, 60 questions):</strong> Pre-algebra to trigonometry</li>
                    <li><strong>Reading (35 min, 40 questions):</strong> Literary narrative, social studies, natural science</li>
                    <li><strong>Science (35 min, 40 questions):</strong> Biology, chemistry, physics, earth science</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Preparation Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take full-length practice tests regularly</li>
                    <li>Focus on the Science section if it's your weakness</li>
                    <li>Practice time management within each section</li>
                    <li>Review all incorrect answers to understand concepts</li>

                explanation: "Prepositions like 'between' require objective case pronouns. 'Me' is correct, not 'I'. A helpful tip: remove the first person and see what sounds right. 'Between you and me' is standard English."
