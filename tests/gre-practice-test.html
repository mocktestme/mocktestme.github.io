                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What's the difference between GRE and GMAT?</h4>
                    <p>The GRE is more general and accepted by most graduate programs, while the GMAT is specifically for business schools. GRE has more vocabulary focus.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How is the GRE scored?</h4>
                    <p>GRE scores range from 130-170 for Verbal and Quantitative sections (combined 260-340). Analytical Writing is scored separately from 0-6.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How long should I prepare?</h4>
                    <p>Most students prepare for 4-6 weeks with 4-5 hours of study per week. Adapt based on your baseline scores and target schools.</p>
