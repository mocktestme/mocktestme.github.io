                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is the DAT required for dental school?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, the DAT is required for admission to virtually all accredited dental schools in North America. It's a critical component of your application.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is a competitive DAT score?</h4>
                    <p>DAT scores range from 1-30 with a mean of 17. Most dental schools prefer scores of 18+. Top schools often look for 20+.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How long should I study for the DAT?</h4>
                    <p>Most students prepare for 2-3 months, studying 3-4 hours daily. The perceptual ability section requires the most additional practice.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I retake the DAT?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, you can retake the DAT, but dental schools see all scores. Most applicants retake only once if necessary.</p>
