                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is the LSAT required for law school?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, virtually all ABA-accredited law schools require the LSAT for admission. It's a critical component of your application.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What LSAT score do I need?</h4>
                    <p>LSAT scores range from 120-180. Most competitive law schools require scores of 160+. Your goal depends on your target schools.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How difficult is the logic games section?</h4>
                    <p>The Analytical Reasoning (logic games) section is notoriously challenging. Most students benefit from 2-3 months of focused practice on this section.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I retake the LSAT?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, you can retake the LSAT multiple times, though law schools see all your scores. A single retake is common for score improvement.</p>

                question: "Legal precedent requires that any law restricting fundamental rights must serve a compelling government interest. The government argues this law is necessary for national security. Therefore, the law is constitutional. Which assumption does this argument depend on?",
