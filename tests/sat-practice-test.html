                <h3>SAT Overview</h3>
                <p>The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It measures critical reading, writing, and mathematical skills that are important for success in college.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>Scoring</h3>

                ],
                explanation: "This is a basic linear equation. Subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to get x = 5. Always verify your answer by substituting back into the original equation."

                explanation: "When using 'neither...nor,' the verb agrees with the nearest subject. However, in standard English, when both subjects could be involved, 'were' is typically used for clarity and emphasis on plurality."

                ],
                explanation: "A fundamental property of triangles is that the sum of all interior angles equals 180°. This is a critical concept for geometry problems. Set up the equation: 45 + 65 + x = 180, then solve for x."

                explanation: "To calculate a percentage: (Percentage/100) × Whole = Part. So: (15/100) × 80 = 0.15 × 80 = 12. This is a fundamental skill for SAT math."
