            <div class="description-content">
                <p>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is a standardized test for assessing English language proficiency. Developed by British Council, IDP IELTS Australia, and Cambridge Assessment English, it is widely recognized by universities, employers, and immigration authorities worldwide.</p>
                <h3>Test Structure</h3>
                <p>IELTS has two versions: Academic and General Training. The Academic version is primarily for university admission, while the General Training version is for work or immigration purposes.</p>
                <h3>Scoring System</h3>
                <p>IELTS is scored on a 9-band scale, with each band representing a different proficiency level from non-user (1) to expert user (9). The overall band score is the average of the four component scores (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking).</p>
